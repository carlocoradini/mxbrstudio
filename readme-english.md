#  Fold n' Blow
> The paper boat racing game

# Game Design Document

> For better solutions let's focus on answering some questions about it...

1. How does the game play?

-   Each user can create a room, and enter any rooms(assuming all being unlocked)
-   When 4 people get together in a room, they can start the match. 
-   In the match, the winner is who is the first to finish the race.
-   In the race, there are 2 steps:
    1.  Paper-fold your boat
    2.  Blowing your boat 


2. How does the game look? 

-   There's the login/register scene for creating the user
-   There's a lobby scene, for chosing or creating rooms, and the "equip" button
-   There's a room scene, for waiting player to join and start the match
-   The match scene:
    -   The paper-fold scene, for each player folding them boats
    -   The blowing scene, where all folded boat are placed and run

-   Extra: Ending scene, for the stats of the match
-   Extra: Equip scene, for chosing your "boat-style"


3. How will the game run?

-   The game will run on a webserver:
    -   The server holds the lobby    
    -   The user holds its match

-   After login, the user enter the server-lobby
> Image reference: Grand Chase PVP Lobby scene

-   In the room, there's the "host" and the others
    -   The others have to mark ready
    -   When all ready host can start match
> Just like the PVP Room scene in Grand Chase


**Extras**:
-   That's it, for now


4. How will the game be made?
